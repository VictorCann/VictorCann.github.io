<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>Choosing the right suspension lift kit for your vehicle can be confusing at times. The Fork Lift Truck licence allows you to operate a Fork Lift Truck for 3 years. 123Forklift has Thousands of used forklifts in stock in over 75 locations across North America making it the largest network of forklift dealers in the U.S and Canada.
