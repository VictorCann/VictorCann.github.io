This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two.

<p>We are offering a large range of Diesel Forklift Rental. Without a disruptive third mast, our wide-channel, dual-mast design gives the H Series forklift unmatched visibility. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts.</p>
