A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience.

<p>Depends on the pallet jack type and capacity. Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile. By visiting your facility, our equipment specialists gain first-hand knowledge of your production, the product you move and challenges experienced by your forklift operators. One type of counterbalance forklift is the three-wheel model which provides better control when driving the truck.</p>
<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
