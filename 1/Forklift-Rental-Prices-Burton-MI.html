Narrow Aisle Trucks greatly mitigate the risk of injuries to the operator as well as damage to property while working in tight spaces. Providing the best value in Linde forklift trucks available today, Granite Industrial Trucks, Inc. Adding a suspension lift kit to your truck is a complex procedure that involves a lot of working parts.

OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
