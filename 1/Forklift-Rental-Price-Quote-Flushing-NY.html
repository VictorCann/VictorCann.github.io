<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Cash Conservation - A long-term rental costs significantly less than purchasing new equipment. CLARK Material Handling Corporation built the Tructractor, and have maintained a presence in the forklift field ever since then. Our forklifts are built rugged & reliable, to the strictest of quality controls according to ISO 9001, and operated in the harshest conditions around the world.</p>
