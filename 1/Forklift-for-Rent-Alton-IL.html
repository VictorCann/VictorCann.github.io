<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend.

<p>The first thing when it comes to owning lifted trucks is to understand how you'd like to spend your money. Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise. Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>
<p>A little more lifting capacity means the 3,500 lb. forklift can do more than the 3,000 lb. But you don't have to sacrifice the small footprint, as the truck sits on the same size frame.
