<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift. The ITA says year-end lift truck sales totaled 260,180, with electric and internal combustion truck sales growing at similar rates (showing annual increases of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively).</p>

<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful.

If your employer deems this certification to be sufficient enough to operate the forklift safely and properly, they will grant you a license. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials. They offer a streamlined credit approval process so you can rent forklifts (and other equipment, if needed) without paying the full price up front.</p>
