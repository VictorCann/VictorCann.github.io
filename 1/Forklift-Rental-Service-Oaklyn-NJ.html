<p>Step 3: Choose Your Truck's Lift Height. POWERED INDUSTRIAL TRUCK: A mobile, power-driven vehicle used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier material. Lifted truck up-fits are either for utility, such as enhancing your truck's capabilities and performance, or to improve its appearance. A lifted body and large tires give you a domineering stance on the road.</p>

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
