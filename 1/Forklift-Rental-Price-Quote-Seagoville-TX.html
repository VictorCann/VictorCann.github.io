<p>Order picker forklifts enable operators to directly pick stock from aisles onto an empty pallet. Narrow Aisle Trucks greatly mitigate the risk of injuries to the operator as well as damage to property while working in tight spaces. Providing the best value in Linde forklift trucks available today, Granite Industrial Trucks, Inc. Adding a suspension lift kit to your truck is a complex procedure that involves a lot of working parts. If you're looking for a little extra clearance and bigger, badder tires for the ultimate off-road experience, this might be exactly the lift you're looking for.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.
