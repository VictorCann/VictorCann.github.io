When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>
<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively.

<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
