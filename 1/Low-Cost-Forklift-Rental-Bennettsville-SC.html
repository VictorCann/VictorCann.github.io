<p>Powered High-Lift Trucks: Order-Picker Safety is an exceptional program which focuses on the issues that will keep your order-pickers safe. Unstable, off-center loads. Reach truck with pantograph attachment that scissors forward from the mast. Also worth noting, I teach to OSHA's forklift standard 1910.178 and cover material related to general industry and not construction-specific subject matter.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>This type of mast is common in rental fleets and just about anywhere else that uses forklifts. The following are examples of Class VI powered industrial trucks. Whether you need a small or large model for a day, a week, or a month, BigRentz has the rough terrain forklift your crew needs.
