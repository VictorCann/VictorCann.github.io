<p>Stone does not offer what would officially be labeled as rough-terrain forklifts, but does have industrial lift products that can be used both indoors and outdoors.

No matter what you are interested in, we have a dedicated customer service team that is ready to guide you through the process of acquiring the lifted vehicle you need.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
