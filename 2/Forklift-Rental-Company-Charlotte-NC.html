<p>Toyota forklifts stand out from the competition in one category. The term fork lift refers to a variety of motor-powered trucks equipped with lifting forks that are used for loading, unloading, and organizing materials that are stacked on pallets or designed for lifting with forks.

Using the wrong lift can hinder productivity and also cause workplace accidents, so please contact our equipment specialist with any questions about forklifts and their applications.</p>
<h2>Lift Truck For Rent Charlotte</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Not only this, but a rough terrain forklift is comfortable and easy to service. A parking brake (or mechanism) shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser. Known for being highly versatile machines, these forklifts are capable of handling heavy loads from 2.5 tonnes up to 7 tonnes.</p>

We provide top notch personnel doing a top notch job to keep your forklift equipment in top notchshape. Unlike a piece of machinery purchased over the Internet, professional forklift dealers specialize in pairing industries with the appropriate machinery — easily matching your business process with a forklift that meets your requirements.</p>
