<p>Side Loader popularity has been declining due to the more advanced multi-directional forklift that has taken its place as the king of long load handling.

Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control. These tools and techniques should make cleaning any lifted truck easier, but finding a good auto detailer may be the more economical option if you can afford it.</p>
