<p>On the basis of end use, the global Pallet Trucks market can be segmented into food & beverage, retail stores, wholesale distribution, freight & logistics and manufacturing and others.

<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body.

<p>Some electric forklift batteries require chargers that must be hard wired and may require a professional for installation. Drivers will also appreciate the better view of the roads in Brownwood, which comes in handy in avoiding obstacles during off-roading journeys.

<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
