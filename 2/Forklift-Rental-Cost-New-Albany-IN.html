<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck. Even for shorter distances you need the performance of the transport truck, because the pallet trucks have to master many difficult situations in a short time: Narrow aisles, tight truck loading bays or steep ramps make goods receiving and transport difficult.</p>

OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

Since counterbalance forklifts are one of the most widely-used types of powered vehicles in the workplace, they fall under typical OSHA training guidelines.

Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet. Class IV - Internal combustion engine trucks with cushion tires are included in Class IV. The vehicle is counter-balanced and has forks and solid tires.</p>

This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
