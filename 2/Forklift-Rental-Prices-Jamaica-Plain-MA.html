<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence.

The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>
