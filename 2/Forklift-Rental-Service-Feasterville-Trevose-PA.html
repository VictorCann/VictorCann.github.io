OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>

Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. We carry both electric and internal combustion forklifts, with capacities from 5,000 to 40,000 pounds and lifts with cushion or pneumatic tires.

Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks also present a danger to those driving in them. The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required.
