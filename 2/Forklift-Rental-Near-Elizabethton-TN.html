Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice.

My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity.</p>
