<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence.

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<p>Safety requirements relating to the elements of design, operation and maintenance of powered industrial trucks - not including vehicles intended primarily for earth moving or over the road hauling. If you know you need a forklift, but aren't sure if you'll encounter another equipment need with the same project, look no further. Industrial trucks are categorized into seven classes based on characteristics, such as engine type, design and size.</p>

Stockpickers are used at elevations higher than the second level of racking in a warehouse or distribution center.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
