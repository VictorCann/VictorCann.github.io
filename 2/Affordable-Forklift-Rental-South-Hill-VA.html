The term fork lift refers to a variety of motor-powered trucks equipped with lifting forks that are used for loading, unloading, and organizing materials that are stacked on pallets or designed for lifting with forks. This type of rough terrain forklift is vehicle-mounted and fitted with a telescopic boom lift, which allows this machine to pick up and transport loads at various distances and heights.</p>
